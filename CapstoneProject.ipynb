    "# Background and Problem Definition\n",
    "At Clear Labs, we develop automated NGS assays based on short and long-read sequencing technology. Many of our products rely on short-read sequencing for its greater data volume and higher accuracy. Some examples of assays include SARs-Cov2 surveillance, microbial isolate sequencing for surveillance, and wastewater surveillance. Each assay is paired with a bioinformatics pipeline that processes sequenced reads from each input sample to answer biological questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these bioinformatics pipelines, filtering steps are applied so that spurious reads, be they low quality or contaminants, do not confound the results or as a bioproduct of mapping reads to a reference genome before further analysis. Losing reads to filtering corresponds directly to lost revenue and lost assay power, as every read thrown out represents a spot on a flowcell that is not providing helpful information. A 50% filtering rate is a 50% reduction in the number of samples that could have been sequenced to a given quality, all things being equal. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one could characterize what kinds of aberrant reads an assay generates, the assay designers could implement changes to mitigate the production of these aberrants in favor of useful reads. For example, if the dropped reads are due to low-intensity spots belonging to overly long insert size fragments, one could apply size banding before PCR to remove long reads. Different procedures to reduce contamination could be utilized if there were many reads from human contamination. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Goals \n",
    "This project aims to develop a WDL ( Workflow Definition Language) workflow that can analyze reads filtered out at any or all stages of a bioinformatic pipeline and automatically generate a helpful report, allowing non-bioinformaticians to understand why reads are being removed. The WDL workflow will consist of various tasks, each running open source or custom code to perform various analyses. The report should break down the filtered reads by each of an arbitrary number of user-defined filtering steps, displaying different categories or clusters of reads lost at the step and their proportion of the total number filtered at a given step. The exact design of the report is subject to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the workflow and reporting code are implemented, this project will demonstrate the utility of such an analysis by running it on some real datasets from historical clear labs development runs, where we know what the cause of high read filtering is, and perhaps an additional, more speculative dataset where we can generate hypotheses. The results of these studies will be compiled into a paper/report in the form of a Jupyter notebook. A GitHub repo with steps to install and run the workflow will be created so that others in the industry can utilize the tool. Finally, I will present the tool to my colleagues in our assay development group and deploy it into our research pipeline.  A stretch goal would be to implement this as a webhosted tool and to extend it to long reads. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Resources and Tools\n",
    "The computational resources for this project will consist of Google Cloud Platform VMs provided by Clear Labs. An example dataset that can be run on a personal computer will be available via GitHub. The data for this project will consist of historical runs from the development of some Clear Labs assays. This data will primarily be short-read NGS data from Sars-Cov2 and microbial samples, but these particular runs will be chosen to demonstrate the utility of dropped reads analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tools I intend to use for this analysis are pending investigation. However, the Workflow Definition Language, run via miniwdl, will be the platform for the analysis as it fits with existing Clear Labs RND pipelines. The goal is to integrate this workflow into our existing software stack. Taxonomy tools such as BLAST, Kraken, and other competitors will be evaluated for their performance and applicability, other motif-based read analysis tools may be implemented until further investigation the extent of additional tools we would like to integrate is unknown. Custom analysis tools may also be developed. Ideally Multiqc with modification to incorporate all the selected tools outputs into a single html report will be utilized. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Application of Knowledge\n",
    "This project will study genomic NGS data, particularly its failure modes, and use in taxonomy assignments. Custom Python and bash code will be utilized to modify existing packages and write scripts to run various workflow tasks. Python or R, as is expedient, will be utilized to write any needed novel analysis modules. An example of a novel analysis module may be the clustering of dropped reads into failure groups using metrics from other tools as features, this will likely use machine learning techniques such as clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Deliverables\n",
    "The Dropped Reads Analysis Pipeline workflow\n",
    "A GitHub repo containing the workflow code and instructions to install and run it\n",
    "A report containing results and analysis of the workflow outputs from multiple historical runs demonstrates the pipeline's efficacy. \n",
    "Jupyter may not work perfectly for this project as it is an open question if I can set the workflow to run within Jupyter, and the .html reports for the example analysis runs will be separate files\n",
    "I would like to discuss how to approach the jupyter notebook requirement further in the context of this more tool and reporting-focused project. \n",
    "A set of html reports that represent the outputs for the test datasets\n",

    "    - This article discusses a type of erroneous sequences known as chimeras, specifically biological chimeras of two sequences from the same organisms. These chimeric reads are generated due to nucleic acid damage, causing DNA from separate parts of the genome to concatenate during sequencing. In this study, the chimeras occurred during the sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, but they can also occur in the microbial context. Chimeras are often dropped in the analysis process and are a potential read class we would like to detect in the Dropped Reads Analysis Pipeline. The article outlines a mechanism to reduce chimeras, indicating that if high chimera levels could be identified the assay could be tweaked to reduce their occurrence. This would increase useful throughput and improve analysis quality overall as not all chimeric reads are dropped, and those that make it through introduce errors, as described in the article. While this article focuses on mapped chimeras, we are also interested in unmapped chimeric reads and should develop tooling to detect these.\n",

The article references several tools, including ChimeraMiner, that I will investigate the feasibility of during the tools investigation stage of the project. It also outlines long read chimera detection, though long reads are a stretch goal of my project. \n",

Many of these issues are thought of as a given at this point in the lifecycle of NGS so they are less discussed in modern papers\n",

The chemical approaches to reduce dimers are irrelevant to my project, other than to highlight that if we can characterize dropped reads as being due to adapter dimers there are a multitude of approaches to reduce their formation. The articles explain how adapter dimers are formed via the ligation of adapters to eachother rather than to sequence fragments, and how these dimers go on to form  clusters on the flowcell. Short dimers can be caught by size selection however if some get through the effect of PCR preferentially amplifying short reads can overpower this. \n",
